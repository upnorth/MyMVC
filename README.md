MyMVC
=====

Model View Controller made in a webdevelopement class based off a template made for our class.

My ambitions with MyMVC (name based on MySQL for lack of a better option) was to make the jargon and general impression of the file-structure, file-names and code in general a little more comprehensable and intuitive compared to the template (Lydia) that the tutorials ended up in.

Controllers are largely what the visitor will perceive as the actual content-generator of the site, and I wanted to make that more apparent in my iteration of the template.
